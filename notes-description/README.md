# oRPG Notes and Description CSS
The following files/images are for use with Notes and Description markdown.

I have included 3 images:
- sidebarsDarkTheme.png - one for SlRvb's dark D&D theme
- sidebars.png - Black (good for light themes)
- sidebarsWhite.png - White (good alternative for dark themes)

## Requires 
- [Obsidian Attributes](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-markdown-attributes)

## Installation:
You will need to copy down and change the URL for the images depending on which one you use. If you use a light theme you will probably want to use "sidebars.png" where as a dark theme you may want to use "sidebarsWhite.png".
