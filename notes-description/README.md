# oRPG Notes and Description CSS
The following files/images are for use with Notes and Description markdown.

Four pairs of styles (each pair blockquote and blockquote::before).
Two pair for Description  (one top, one side).
Two pair for GM Note  (one top, one side).
   
   **Notes:**
   - You can easily change(or add more) by changing the "content:" tag
   - May have to adjust the top/right depending on FONT sizes



I have included 6 images:
- sidebarsDarkTheme.png - one for SlRvb's dark D&D theme
- sidebars.png - Black (good for light themes)
- sidebarsWhite.png - White (good alternative for dark themes)
- note-wrap.png - Black (good for light themes)
- note-wrapDarkTheme.png - one I use for SlRvb's Dark D&D Theme
- note-wrapWhite.png - White (good alternative for dark themes)

## Requires 
- [Obsidian Attributes](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-markdown-attributes)

## Installation:
You will need to copy down and change the URL for the images depending on which one you use. If you use a light theme you will probably want to use "sidebars.png" where as a dark theme you may want to use "sidebarsWhite.png".

**Note:** 
You can set the width of the boxes using Attributes settings: 
{class=oRPGGMDescription style="width:200px"} 

***GM Note***
```
> **Trap**
> A secret trap door hidden in the floor just inside as players enter the room.
> *DC Spot:* 14
> *DC Disarm:* 12
{class=oRPGGMNote}
```



**Description Box**
```
> **Mess Hall**
> Your torch allows you to see remnants of what once must've been a mess hall of sorts, demolished and consumed by time itself. 
{class=oRPGGMDescription style="width:200px"}
```
*Above example allows you to set the width of the boxes using Attributes for each instance.*
