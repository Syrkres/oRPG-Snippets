# HTML template for Domain
Base on [Matt Colville's Kingdom's and Warfare](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/kingdoms-and-warfare-book). Highly recommend!

The MD code and CSS snippets here are for creating a Domain Sheet within Obsidian which is used for Kingdoms and Warfare published by Matt Colville (MCD). It's a blank template and users will have to fill in the details, but allows you to focus on content rather than formatting.
